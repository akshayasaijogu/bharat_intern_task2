## Overview
The project uses machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to assess medical data and provide predictions on heart disease risk. The Streamlit app provides a seamless user interface for making predictions and visualizing data insights.

## Features
- *Interactive Streamlit App*: Allows users to input health data and receive real-time predictions of heart disease risk.
- *Customizable Algorithms*: Users can explore different machine learning algorithms and optimize model parameters.
- *Data Visualization*: Visualize input data and prediction results through graphs and charts.
   

## Usage
To launch the Streamlit app, use the following command:
bash
streamlit run app.py

The app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes a publicly available heart disease dataset containing features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical history data. Further details on data sources can be found in the code and documentation.
